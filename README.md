### Hi there, I'm [Gaurav!](https://quickdevnotes.com) ðŸ‘‹

A Software Engineer from India. 

I'm a [public speaker](https://www.quickdevnotes.com/speaking/) and open source contributor.

I share about my work, and learning on my blog [QuickDevNotes](https://www.quickdevnotes.com/). I also share my experience at different events and tech on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/quickdevnotes/). 

When I'm not coding, I like to go out for a ride :bicyclist: or play badminton. I also like to stay home and play :guitar: singing along my favorite songs.
